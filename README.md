unsupervised Machine Learning | Clustering with KMeans

The notebook in this repository contains the clustering of a sample set of 5000 songs using some of Spotify's attributes. The clustering was done using KMeans.
Additionally the quality assessment of the clustering is done using inertia- and silhouette scores and finally seaborn-created heatmaps of those clusters.
